In this post I will explain why I really like to write things down when it comes to product development, and
the different benefits I've seen from it.

I have been doing product development for a while now (since 2008ish). During this time I have gone through a bunch
of phases as a software developer. One big change to the way I work came about the first time I had a remote product owner.
We were a bunch of developers in Europe and the PO was in San Franscisco. This PO was a veteran in the game, but neither him nor the devs had much experience working as a remote team. Communication was a big problem, the PO frequently
felt like he had insufficent information on what was going on. Our tool to manage work items was JIRA at the time.

After struggling for a while, trying out different things to reduce the friction between the developers and the PO we found some things that made life easier for everyone. These things have stuck with me until this day, and I have expanded on them.

The thing that made a big difference was to break stories down into smaller sub tasks, and assigning them. Together with leaving comments frequently on the sub task about what was going on in them.
The cool thing that happened when the developers started doing this was that not only did the PO have better insight, it made the whole dev process much more transparent to everyone, including other stakeholders.
It also made us all better at breaking down stories into thinner slices.

Let me explain in a bit more detail what sub tasks and assigning them means here. A sub task is a small, usually less than 2 days thing to do (often a sub task will spawn additional sub task as new information is uncovered). It is assigned to someone who is responsible for getting the sub task to "Done". The person
it is assigned to should be able to answer any questions about progress/status/tradeoffs etc. It does not mean that there's only one person working on it though.

The big benefit with the approach is that you

1. Aggressively visualize the work that is being done, including things that turn out to be more challening than expected
2. Leave breadcrums in the form of comments for others to understand what is going on in even more detail if needed. This can be especially useful for other developers that might join you for pair programming, or reviewing. It can even be useful to yourself after coming back from time off.

I think some readers will now ask the inevitable "how do I juggle this with everything else?". The key is to
develop good habits. Which is hard, and may never become automatic.
